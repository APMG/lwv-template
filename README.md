# League of Women Voters/MPR News Voter’s Guide template

The file `index.html` is a self-contained, responsive template that can wrap around the LWV voter’s guide widget.

All CSS styles live in the `head`, and all logos are inline SVGs (with appropriate ARIA labels) or inline base64-encoded PNGs (with appropriate `alt` attributes).
